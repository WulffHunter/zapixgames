# zapixgames
In-development repo with game components

## Building
To build the engine, you'll first need to install [rust].

Linux/OSX users: `curl -sSf https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sh`
Windows users can install the binary from [rust]'s homepage.

Now you just need to clone the repo and run the engine:

```
git clone https://github.com/WulffHunter/zapixgames
cd zapixgames
cargo run
```

That should be it for now, hack away!
